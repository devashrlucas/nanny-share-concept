        <li class="faq-question">What Is A Nanny Share?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer"> Typically, a nanny share is when two or more families agree to split the cost of hiring a nanny. For families, nanny share programs can offer a cost-effective option for child care.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-question">How Does Sharing A Nanny Work?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer">The specific agreement for sharing a nanny must be worked out between the families involved. A common way to share a nanny between families is for the nanny to watch the children as a group at the homes of one of the families. The families would then work out a schedule for alternating the homes that the children would stay at. For instance, the nanny could watch the children at the home of family A one week then
          at the home of family B the following week.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-question">How Do I Find A Family To Share With?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer">This is where the nanny share program liason comes in! The main role of the liason is to help match families and nannies within our neighborhood. After the initial program registration period has closed, the liason will send out a detailed questionnaire in order to try to accomodate all of the families who have expressed interest in the program.
        <br>
        <br>
        All we ask is that, once a family has agreed to participate in our nanny share program, that the family continues to work through the liason during the initial matching period so that the liason can coordinate changes to the matches should they arise.
        Although it may be quicker to send a text or email to a potential match, allowing the liason to coordinate the matches will ensure that our program can accomodate as many families as possible.</li>
