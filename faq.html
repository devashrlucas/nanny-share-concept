        <li class="faq-question">What Is A Nanny Share?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer"> Typically, a nanny share is when two or more families agree to split the cost of hiring a nanny. 
          For families, nanny share programs can offer a cost-effective option for child care.
        <br>
        <br>
         For our program, "nanny share" will also include general babysitting. 
         Although "babysitters" and "nannies" have different roles and responsibilies, the underlying goal of the program is to assist families with spliting the cost of child care. 
         Families will have the opportunity to specify their expectations during the enrollment process.
        <br>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-question">How Does Sharing A Nanny Work?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer">The specific agreement for sharing a nanny must be worked out between the families involved. 
          A common way to share a nanny between families is for the nanny to watch the children as a group at the home of one of the families. 
          The families could then work out a schedule for alternating hosting. For instance, the nanny could watch the children at the home of family A one week then
          at the home of family B the following week.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-question">How Do I Find A Family To Share With?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer">This is where the nanny share program liason comes in!
           The main role of the liason is to help match families and nannies within our neighborhood.
           After the initial program registration period has closed, the liason will send out a detailed questionnaire in order to try to accomodate all of the families who have expressed interest in the program.
           Finally, after reviewing the questionnaire responses, the liason will then follow up with short phone call to confirm program interest before they begin matching families.
        <br>
        <br>
        All we ask is that, once a family has agreed to participate in our nanny share program, that the family continues to work through the liason during the initial matching period so that the liason can coordinate changes to the matches should they arise.
        Although it may be quicker to send a text or email to a potential match, allowing the liason to coordinate matches will ensure that our program can accomodate as many families as possible.</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-question">How Do I Find A Nanny To Share?</li>
        <br>
        <li class="faq-answer">After the initial matching period has finished, the liason will then help familes find a potential nanny to share based on the families' needs and schedules.
           Throughout the year, the liason will screen nanny candidates to be a part of the program.
           By the time the family matches have been completed, the liason will have a pool of nanny candidates to recommend from.       
        <br>
        <br>
        Families participating in our nanny share program are not required to work with the nanny candidate that is initially recommended to them.
         The liason will be happy to see if there is another nanny candidate that can accomodate the match's needs. 
         <br>
         <br>
         If a match decides to withdraw from the program and look elsewhere for a nanny, please let the liason know as soon as possible.</li>
         <br>
         <li class="faq-question">How Can I Apply To Be A Nanny Candidate?</li>
         <br>
         <li class="faq-answer"> An interest/contact information form will be sent out throughout the year via the electronic version of the neighborhood newsletter. 
          The liason will follow up applicants to confirm interest and send out the formal application form. If the application is approved, the liason will reach out to schedule an in-person interview with either themselves or the neighborhood associataion Executive Director for a final approval. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Although prior experience is not a requirement, all formal applications must be submitted the with required number of references for serious consideration. Please contact the liason if you have any questions regarding this requirement.
         </li> 
         <br>
         <li class="faq-question">Is There A Fee To Participate In The Program? </li>
         <br>
         <li class="faq-answer"> Yes, there is a $10 non-refundable fee for matching families.
           Familes can withdraw free of charge any time before the liason starts matching families. 
           The revenue generated from this fee goes towards the neighborhood associataion's general fund.
